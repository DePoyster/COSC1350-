*Changes I made to my webpage and why. Each listed item follows the same format as the style sheet.


* First started with a CSS reset.



* Set the background color for the body element of the webpage
to be an apricot color. Just to make the website more unique!



* Added the max-width of the image tag to be 100%
Although it wasn't neccassary it will always be consistent to every page.

* Set the margin-left and margin-right to auto. I did this to make the image
of me become centered to the page.




* Aligned the text in my header to be center and made the color blue
and the background color black. While I didn't need to change the background
color it helps show me what is considered the header.

* Added a font family to be times new roman and aligned the text to the center,
made the html page look formal.


* Next selector being the iframe, kept the height of the iframe but changed
the width to always be 100% to the windows current length, orignally I wanted to change
it to keep the same dimensions but to center it but couldn't find a way so I decided to make it
even by making the width span across the whole page.


* Alinged the main and footer content to the center. Don't have too much to add or change just yet.

* Have a specified class called "linked", added this to all my 
links to each page, helps define my links to each page by making it bolder, bigger,
and fancier (different fonts). Also aligns the links to be centered.


* had a div id that specifies the h1 element to that id, underlines the text above 
the iframe and while creating some space to help define the area.


* Had the contactInformation div selector that specifies the list,
changes the font size, content alignment to the center, changes the color, adds spacing between each
listed item with padding, and add a unique font to the list. The content is easier to read now
and looks better as a result.


* The next id specifies a section where I made the list talking about myself,
made the content easier to read and more defined by adding larger font size and 
aligning the text to the center. Also changed the color and added padding between each listed item.
