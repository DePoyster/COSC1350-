I want you to create a simple tip calculator. The basic form was created in Module 7. 
You will be writing the JavaScript code and adding the triggers and bindings needed to make the application work. 
Use the following approach:



JavaScript file to make the calculator work:

The script should be triggered once the window fully loads. 

Bind the button's click event to a function (maybe call it calculateTip).

The function will retrieve the user-entered values for amount and service quality.

There should be a validation check to ensure that the bill amount is not empty.

if()

The function, when triggered, will multiply the bill amount and service quality selection. 
The result will be displayed (and formatted) on the webpage. 
Note that you will need to have the values of each service quality defined (i.e., .25 for 25%).


Hi Dr.T I have a few questions relating to the midterm project.
My first question is when you describe that the scritp should be tringgered as soon as the window loads, does 
this mean to execute the result of the tip calculator already before inserting values?
My second question is that you wantt to results to be displayed and formatted on the webpage, if I understand
tnis means you would not want us to use the alert to represent the results but rather use some form of code and html
formatting to have something like a box that shows the results of the calculator code?
