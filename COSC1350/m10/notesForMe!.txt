Exception has occurred: TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'onchange')

this occured on like 14 of the JS file and for the longest time I was having issue solving this.
It was only until I put my script at the end of the body that not only was the website properly loading 
but the output actually showed.

*Alternatively I tried to the defer statment in the script and it worked!

* The second Issue I had was with getting the window alert, this was because I didn't have the m10 folder in my own personal folder but rather its own 
folder that it was retrieved from.
