What I learned today:

* It is possible for Scritps to share data with one another as long as they're referenced by the same
webpage


* This code displays that it is possible to reference css in JS to determine what properties 
a section of a webpage will have.


* The JS file also shows the importance of use of arrays as in the js03_txt.js file we minimize the amount 
content we have to write by using arrays in the functions and loops that we create.
